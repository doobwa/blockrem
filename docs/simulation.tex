\section{Simulation}

We check our model fitting procedure using a small synthetic data set involving 10 nodes from 2 groups where 1) within group communication is more likely, 2) events among members in the first group are more likely to be reciprocated  (i.e. a positive \texttt{ab-ba} effect), and 3) events among members of the second group are more likely to be followed by an event with the same sender (i.e. a positive \texttt{ab-ay} effect).  The specification of $\textbf{s}$ is therefore $\textbf{s}(t,i,j,\mathcal{A}_t) = [s_0, s_{1}(t,i,j,\mathcal{A}_t), s_{2}(t,i,j,\mathcal{A}_t)]$.  For the synthetic data set we use parameter vectors $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{1,1} = (0,3,0)$,  $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{1,2} = \boldsymbol{\beta}_{2,1} = (-1,0,0)$, and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{2,2} = (0,2,0)$.
Data is generated by sequentially computing $\lambda_{ij}(t_m|\cdot)$ for all $(i,j) \in \mathcal{R}$, drawing $t_{m+1}-t_m \sim \mbox{Exp}(\sum_{ij} \lambda_{ij}(t_m|\cdot))$, and drawing the dyad $(i,j) \sim \mbox{Categorical}(\lambda_{ij}(t_m|\cdot) / \sum_{ij}\lambda_{ij}(t_m|\cdot))$.

Though the dyad counts for the synthetic data set suggest a stochastic blockmodel (as seen in Figure  \ref{fig:syncounts}),  the center plot shows each block has empirical differences in their dynamics.
Intensities for reciprocal actions among nodes in block 1 are $e^3$ times greater, intensities for turn-taking actions among nodes in group 2 are $e^2$ times greater, and intensities for dyadic interactions between the two groups have a multiplicative effect of $e^{-1}$ and thus occur less often.
Fitting the model with $K=2$ has similar  predictive accuracy as the true model (see Table \ref{tab:results}), recovers the true latent classes, and the posterior credible intervals of the parameters cover the true parameter values (see Figure \ref{fig:syncounts}c).
