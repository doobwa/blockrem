Need to change block.ps to instead look at dyad-specific p-shifts.
[done?] Use a visualization of these p-shifts to explore the properities of the synthetic data.
[done] Fix llk, writeup to account for sender/receiver for both i and j
Fix pshift to account for self link issue
Clean up write up and send to Padhraic.  
Get sense of size of dataset we can use.
[done] Write mle for dyad-indpenent REM model.  (Double check llk function.)
Write sampler for blockmodel.
Fit blockmodel to synthetic data.
