[done] Need to change block.ps to instead look at dyad-specific p-shifts.
[done?] Use a visualization of these p-shifts to explore the properities of the synthetic data.
[done] Fix llk, writeup to account for sender/receiver for both i and j
[done] Fix pshift to account for self link issue
[done] Clean up write up and send to Padhraic.  
[done] Get sense of size of dataset we can use.
[done] Write mle for dyad-indpenent REM model.  (Double check llk function.)
[done] Write sampler for blockmodel.
[done] Fit blockmodel to synthetic data.

Week 2: 
[done] Write SBM code.
[done] Fit SBM to subset of Eckmann (dyadic only)
[done] Fit REM separately to each block.
Understand collinearity/identifiability issue.
[done] Implement BREM for submodels by modifying MH call in MCMC.
Setup prediction llk experiment and ranking code. Handle case where we have draws from posterior.
Setup experiment comparing submodels on synthetic data: k=1 and just intercept, k=1, beta for diag and gamma for off diag, and full model.
Explore performance of approximate likelihood.
Consider MIT dataset or classroom dataset.
Write up other possibilities for layering additional types of data, DP, or other extensions.
Try random groups and see if REM still picks out (significantly) different parameters
Port simulator over to Rcpp.
Add other statistics other than pshifts
