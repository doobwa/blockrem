[done] Need to change block.ps to instead look at dyad-specific p-shifts.
[done?] Use a visualization of these p-shifts to explore the properities of the synthetic data.
[done] Fix llk, writeup to account for sender/receiver for both i and j
[done] Fix pshift to account for self link issue
[done] Clean up write up and send to Padhraic.  
[done] Get sense of size of dataset we can use.
[done] Write mle for dyad-indpenent REM model.  (Double check llk function.)
[done] Write sampler for blockmodel.
[done] Fit blockmodel to synthetic data.

Week 2: 
[done] Write SBM code.
[done] Fit SBM to subset of Eckmann (dyadic only)
[done] Fit REM separately to each block.
[done] Implement BREM for submodels by modifying MH call in MCMC.
[done] Setup prediction llk experiment and ranking code. Handle case where we have draws from posterior.
[done] Setup experiment comparing submodels on synthetic data: k=1 and just intercept, k=1, beta for diag and gamma for off diag, and full model.
[done. not successful.] Noncollapsing clusters: try initializing beta centered on the mean overall rate.
[done] Download some twitter data
[done] Explore performance of approximate likelihood. [Needs roughly N/2 to be good in simple examples.]
Debug issues with whether to include intercept term or not. (Understand collinearity/identifiability issue.)
[done] Reimplement brem.llk to take account of affected (i,j) that aren't in block (a,b).
[done] Reimplement brem code with Arrays
[done] Understand why we do better than truth on llk/ranking. [It was a bug in llk.]
[done, still buggy] Make faster llk function that doesn't use lrm w/ llk.
[done. overhead too big?] Try to speed up with OpenMP
Implement gibbs sampler for latent group assignment.
- Pass tests with one that computes mp ahead of time.
- Determine what's slowing things down.  Overhead?
Compare submodels for eckmann subset.
Write abstract.
Add px feature to define which parameters to fit.
See if we can learn groups on synthetic data.
Derive/implement EM for baseline model.
Write up other possibilities for layering additional types of data, DP, or other extensions.
Try random groups and see if REM still picks out (significantly) different parameters
Consider MIT dataset or classroom dataset.
Clean up interfaces to Rcpp code.
Add other statistics other than pshifts
Initialize with guess at z's, rather than guess at beta.
Research maximization of beta rather than sampling.

Low priority:
Port simulator over to Rcpp.
