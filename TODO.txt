[done] Need to change block.ps to instead look at dyad-specific p-shifts.
[done?] Use a visualization of these p-shifts to explore the properities of the synthetic data.
[done] Fix llk, writeup to account for sender/receiver for both i and j
[done] Fix pshift to account for self link issue
[done] Clean up write up and send to Padhraic.  
[done] Get sense of size of dataset we can use.
[done] Write mle for dyad-indpenent REM model.  (Double check llk function.)
[done] Write sampler for blockmodel.
[done] Fit blockmodel to synthetic data.

Week 2: 
Write SBM code.
Fit SBM to Eckmann (dyadic only)
Fit REM separately to each block.
Fit REM to all Eckmann.
Setup experiment comparing submodels: k=1 and just intercept, k=1, beta for diag and gamma for off diag, and full model.
Setup prediction llk experiment and ranking code. Handle case where we have draws from posterior.
Port simulator over to Rcpp.
Consider MIT dataset or classroom dataset.
Write up other possibilities for layering additional types of data, DP, or other extensions.
