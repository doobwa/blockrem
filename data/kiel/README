Data described in:
H. Ebel, L.-I. Mielsch, and S. Bornholdt, Scale-free topology of e-mail networks, Phys. Rev. E 66 (2002) 035103(R).

Description of the data

The data are in a gzipped ascii file with the following format. Each line corresponds to one link (i.e., e-mail) from the first to the second address. As described in detail in the above paper, e-mail addresses correspond to internal ("s") and external ("x") nodes. An exemplary line of the file is explained below. Users and domains were made anonymous by the service provider. 

Example

month	day	time	internal/external	user(source)    @	domain(source)	internal/external	user(destination)	@	domain(destination)
sep	16	03:36:25	x	00004066	@	00002192	s	00006210	@	00001208
