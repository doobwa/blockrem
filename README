Fitting a BREM model to several datasets on several datalab machines 
with a variety of settings:

./parallel --sshlogin 8/d7,8/d8 \
   'cd /extra/duboisc0/blockrem \ 
    ./brem.r \
   -d {1} -k {2} -n 500 -s {3} -g {4} -b {5} -e 5' \
   ::: "synthetic-1" "eckmann-small" "twitter-small" "realitymining-small" \
   ::: 10 \
   ::: FALSE \
   ::: FALSE TRUE \
   ::: FALSE TRUE

Making predictions on fitted models for multiple datasets:

./parallel --sshlogin  4/d11,6/d12 \
   'cd /extra/duboisc0/blockrem;./predict.r -d {1}' ::: \
   "synthetic-1" "realitymining-small" "eckmann-small" \
   "classroom-16" "classroom-17" "classroom-27" "classroom-29"\
   "classroom-31" "enron-small"
